# Developing Slurm Bridge

## Local Kind cluster

The workstation needs Make, Docker, Kind, Skaffold, Helm, kubectl, and Go.
Create a development cluster and deploy the complete bridge stack:

```sh
make kind-start
```

Use `make deploy` for a one-time rebuild or `make debug` for Delve-enabled
images. Delete the cluster with:

```sh
make kind-stop
```

The generated `helm/slurm-bridge/values-dev.yaml` file is a sparse, untracked
override. Add only values needed for development. Skaffold resets the release to
the current chart defaults before applying these overrides. If an older file is
a full copy of `values.yaml`, replace it with `{}` so it does not pin defaults
from an older checkout.

## End-to-end tests

The end-to-end suite can exercise either supported Slurm node mode. External
mode is the default:

```sh
make kind-start test-e2e
```

Use a separate cluster for hybrid mode because an installed cluster cannot
switch node modes in place:

```sh
KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=slurm-bridge-hybrid \
SLURM_NODE_MODE=hybrid \
make kind-start test-e2e
```

[Batch placeholders](config.md#batch-placeholders) need hybrid nodes and their
own cluster too. This also installs the hold epilog with a 120 s `HOLD_MAX`:

```sh
KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=slurm-bridge-batch \
SLURM_NODE_MODE=hybrid SLURM_PLACEHOLDER=batch \
make kind-start test-e2e
```

Select another supported Kubernetes version with `KUBERNETES_VERSION`:

```sh
KIND_CLUSTER_NAME=slurm-bridge-1-36 \
KUBERNETES_VERSION=v1.36 \
make kind-start test-e2e
```

The suite only talks to the kubeconfig context named by `E2E_KUBE_CONTEXT`,
which defaults to `kind-$KIND_CLUSTER_NAME`. It never falls back to the current
context. Set it explicitly to test a cluster that was not created by
`kind-start`.

`SLURM_NODE_MODE` is also passed into the test process. The readiness feature
uses it to verify that the cluster actually contains external nodes or
DaemonSet-mode hybrid `slurmd` pods, as requested. Hybrid runs also include a
native `sbatch` feature labeled `slurm-node-mode=hybrid`, which verifies that a
job submitted directly to Slurm completes on one of those hybrid workers.

After the serial readiness check, independent workload features run in parallel.
Slurm may queue jobs when the suite temporarily asks for more nodes than are
available, so each feature allows up to ten minutes for an allocation.

Use `E2E_RUN` with a Go test regular expression to select one feature. Set
`E2E_CLEANUP=false` to leave the successful workload in place for debugging:

```sh
MOCK_NVML=true \
E2E_RUN='TestScheduling/Non-exclusive_DRA_resources_allocated_to_container$' \
E2E_CLEANUP=false \
make kind-start test-e2e
```

The cluster is never removed by `test-e2e`; `make kind-stop` remains explicit.
Cancellation features still remove their workload because deletion is the
behavior they validate.

## Remote cluster

Install a compatible released Slinky stack first. The workstation running the
deployment needs Kubernetes API access, push access to a registry, and a
registry namespace that the cluster can pull from.

Select the Kubernetes context and registry, then deploy the local checkout:

```sh
export SKAFFOLD_KUBE_CONTEXT=my-remote-cluster
export SKAFFOLD_DEFAULT_REPO=ghcr.io/my-user
make deploy
```

Skaffold builds and pushes the bridge images, then Helm upgrades Slurm Bridge
using the current chart defaults and `values-dev.yaml` overrides. Existing
release values are not retained, so add any required cluster-specific values to
`values-dev.yaml` before deploying.

## Specialized fixtures

Install all optional Kind development fixtures:

```sh
./hack/kind.sh --extras slurm-bridge-dev
```

This installs the CPU, example GPU, NVIDIA GPU, and DRANET DRA drivers. Each
driver can still be installed individually with `--dra-driver-cpu`,
`--dra-example-driver`, `--dra-driver-nvidia-gpu`, or `--dranet`. The `--dranet`
fixture creates a `dranet0` dummy interface on each managed Kind worker before
installing the driver.

The `--dra-example-driver` and `--dranet` flags also configure Slurm Bridge with
the [e2e device profiles](../hack/e2e-device-profiles.yaml). This explicitly
enables the example GPU and dummy network interface profiles alongside the
built-in profiles. The example GPU profile is disabled by default.

NVIDIA GPU DRA normally requires GPU-equipped workers with the NVIDIA driver
installed on the host. For local testing without GPUs, set `MOCK_NVML=true` to
install
[`nvml-mock`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-test-infra/tree/main/deployments/nvml-mock)
on the managed Kind workers before the NVIDIA DRA driver:

```sh
MOCK_NVML=true make kind-start
```

Examples remain individually selectable:

```sh
kubectl apply -f hack/examples/job/single.yaml
kubectl apply -f hack/examples/dra/dranet/job.yaml
kubectl apply -f hack/examples/dra/gpu-example/job.yaml
kubectl apply -f hack/examples/dra/nvidia/job.yaml
```

## Demo

Create the core stack, install all optional fixtures, and run a curated set of
finite example workloads:

```sh
make demo-start
```

Watch the workloads and their corresponding Slurm jobs until interrupted with
`Ctrl+C`:

```sh
./hack/watch.sh --demo
```

For an annotated view, or an annotated split-screen view with `tmux`, run:

```sh
./hack/watch.sh --explain
./hack/watch.sh --explain --tmux
```

The watchers require `watch`; the split-screen mode also requires `tmux`.
Stopping a watcher does not remove the demo workloads. Remove them with:

```sh
make demo-stop
```

The cluster remains available for development. Delete it with `make kind-stop`.

Optional system diagnostics remain a direct command:

```sh
sudo ./hack/sysctl.sh
```
