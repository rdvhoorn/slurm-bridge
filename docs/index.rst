Overview
--------

`Slurm <https://slurm.schedmd.com/overview.html>`__ and
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__ are workload managers originally
designed for different kinds of workloads. Kubernetes excels at
scheduling workloads that run for an indefinite amount of time, with
potentially vague resource requirements, on a single node, with loose
policy, but can scale its resource pool infinitely to meet demand; Slurm
excels at quickly scheduling workloads that run for a finite amount of
time, with well-defined resource requirements and topology, on multiple
nodes, with strict policy, and a known resource pool.

This project enables the best of both workload managers. It contains a
`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__ scheduler to manage select
workloads from Kubernetes, which allows for co-location of Kubernetes
and Slurm workloads within the same cluster. This means the same
hardware can be used to run both traditional HPC and cloud-like
workloads, reducing operating costs. On hybrid nodes, the hardware is
shared over time unless co-resident mode is enabled: a physical node
must not run native Slurm user workloads and Slurm-bridge-managed
Kubernetes user workloads simultaneously. Kubernetes and Slurm system
daemons are expected to remain co-located on those nodes.

Using ``slurm-bridge``, workloads can be submitted from within a
Kubernetes context as a ``Pod``, ``PodGroup``, ``Job``, ``JobSet``, or
``LeaderWorkerSet`` and from a Slurm context using ``salloc`` or
``sbatch``. Workloads submitted via Slurm will execute as they would in
a Slurm-only environment, using ``slurmd``. Workloads submitted from
Kubernetes will have their resource requirements translated into a
representative Slurm job by ``slurm-bridge``. That job will serve as an
external job and will be scheduled by the Slurm controller. Upon
resource allocation to a K8s workload by the Slurm controller,
``slurm-bridge`` will bind the workload’s pod(s) to the allocated
node(s). At that point, the kubelet will launch and run the pod the same
as it would within a standard Kubernetes instance.

Features
--------

Slurm
~~~~~

Slurm is a full featured HPC workload manager. To highlight a few
features:

- `Priority <https://slurm.schedmd.com/priority_multifactor.html>`__:
  assigns priorities to jobs upon submission and on an ongoing basis
  (e.g. as they age).
- `Preemption <https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html>`__: stop one or
  more low-priority jobs to let a high-priority job run.
- `QoS <https://slurm.schedmd.com/qos.html>`__: sets of policies
  affecting scheduling priority, preemption, and resource limits.
- `Fairshare <https://slurm.schedmd.com/fair_tree.html>`__: distribute
  resources equitably among users and accounts based on historical
  usage.

Compatibility
-------------

Each minor release supports all Kubernetes minor versions that are
`supported upstream <https://kubernetes.io/releases/>`__ when it is
released, starting with Kubernetes 1.35. That set is recorded for each
minor release. Support for newer Kubernetes minors may be backported in
a patch release after end-to-end validation; these backports are
optional.

========= =============== =============== ===============
Release   Kubernetes 1.35 Kubernetes 1.36 Kubernetes 1.37
========= =============== =============== ===============
``1.3.X`` ✓               ✓               ✓
``1.2.X`` ✓               ✓               —
``1.1.X`` ✓               ✓               —
``1.0.X`` ✓               ✓               —
========= =============== =============== ===============

✓ means supported; — means unsupported. ``X`` denotes the patch version.
Use the latest patch release in each minor release series. Backported
support is marked with the first supporting patch version.

Limitations
-----------

- Unless co-resident mode is enabled, bridge jobs use exclusive,
  whole-node allocations by default, and workloads that request
  non-exclusive placement always use Slurm MCS workload isolation.
- Supports `DRA Driver
  CPU <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-cpu>`__ for CPUs,
  plus indexed GPU and accelerator drivers mapped to Slurm GRES through
  configured device profiles. The chart includes profiles for `DRA
  Example
  Driver <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-example-driver>`__ and
  `NVIDIA DRA
  Driver <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dra-driver-nvidia-gpu>`__
  GPUs plus RDMA-capable
  `DRANET <https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/dranet>`__ devices by
  default, and retains its specialized `NVIDIA
  k8s-dra-driver-gpu <https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-dra-driver-gpu>`__
  path.
- NVIDIA GPU backend selection is resource-name based:
  ``deviceclass.resource.kubernetes.io/gpu.nvidia.com`` selects the
  NVIDIA DRA DeviceClass, while ``nvidia.com/gpu`` selects the NVIDIA
  device plugin. ``DeviceClass.spec.extendedResourceName`` aliases are
  not resolved by ``slurm-bridge``; use the implicit DeviceClass
  resource name for NVIDIA DRA.
- Native ``cpu`` requests do not activate CPU DRA. Pods must explicitly
  request ``deviceclass.resource.kubernetes.io/dra.cpu`` and cannot
  combine it with native ``cpu`` requests or limits.
- Native CPU requests reserve CPU capacity in Slurm, but do not
  constrain the container to Slurm’s allocated CPU set. Native
  containers share CPUs not claimed through DRA, so native Slurm
  allocations may overlap their effective CPU sets; use CPU DRA for
  aligned CPU isolation.

Installation
------------

Create a secret for slurm-bridge to communicate with Slurm.

.. code:: sh

   export $(scontrol token username=slurm lifespan=infinite)
   kubectl create namespace slurm
   kubectl create namespace slurm-bridge
   kubectl create secret generic slurm-bridge-token --namespace=slurm --from-literal="SLURM_JWT=$SLURM_JWT" --type=Opaque

Install the slurm-bridge scheduler:

.. code:: sh

   helm install slurm-bridge oci://ghcr.io/slinkyproject/charts/slurm-bridge \
     --namespace=slurm --create-namespace
