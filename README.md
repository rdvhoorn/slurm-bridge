## Overview

[Slurm] and [Kubernetes] are workload managers originally designed for different
kinds of workloads. Kubernetes excels at scheduling workloads that run for an
indefinite amount of time, with potentially vague resource requirements, on a
single node, with loose policy, but can scale its resource pool infinitely to
meet demand; Slurm excels at quickly scheduling workloads that run for a finite
amount of time, with well-defined resource requirements and topology, on
multiple nodes, with strict policy, and a known resource pool.

This project enables the best of both workload managers. It contains a
[Kubernetes] scheduler to manage select workloads from Kubernetes, which allows
for co-location of Kubernetes and Slurm workloads within the same cluster. This
means the same hardware can be used to run both traditional HPC and cloud-like
workloads, reducing operating costs. On hybrid nodes, the hardware is shared
over time: a physical node must not run native Slurm user workloads and
Slurm-bridge-managed Kubernetes user workloads simultaneously. Kubernetes and
Slurm system daemons are expected to remain co-located on those nodes.

Using `slurm-bridge`, workloads can be submitted from within a Kubernetes
context as a `Pod`, `PodGroup`, `Job`, `JobSet`, or `LeaderWorkerSet` and from a
Slurm context using `salloc` or `sbatch`. Workloads submitted via Slurm will
execute as they would in a Slurm-only environment, using `slurmd`. Workloads
submitted from Kubernetes will have their resource requirements translated into
a representative Slurm job by `slurm-bridge`. That job will serve as an external
job and will be scheduled by the Slurm controller. Upon resource allocation to a
K8s workload by the Slurm controller, `slurm-bridge` will bind the workload's
pod(s) to the allocated node(s). At that point, the kubelet will launch and run
the pod the same as it would within a standard Kubernetes instance.

## Features

### Slurm

Slurm is a full featured HPC workload manager. To highlight a few features:

- [**Priority**][slurm-priority]: assigns priorities to jobs upon submission and
  on an ongoing basis (e.g. as they age).
- [**Preemption**][slurm-preempt]: stop one or more low-priority jobs to let a
  high-priority job run.
- [**QoS**][slurm-qos]: sets of policies affecting scheduling priority,
  preemption, and resource limits.
- [**Fairshare**][slurm-fairshare]: distribute resources equitably among users
  and accounts based on historical usage.

## Compatibility

Each minor release supports all Kubernetes minor versions that are
[supported upstream](https://kubernetes.io/releases/) when it is released,
starting with Kubernetes 1.35. That set is recorded for each minor release.
Support for newer Kubernetes minors may be backported in a patch release after
end-to-end validation; these backports are optional.

| Release | Kubernetes 1.35 | Kubernetes 1.36 | Kubernetes 1.37 |
| :------ | :-------------: | :-------------: | :-------------: |
| `1.3.X` |        ✓        |        ✓        |        ✓        |
| `1.2.X` |        ✓        |        ✓        |        —        |
| `1.1.X` |        ✓        |        ✓        |        —        |
| `1.0.X` |        ✓        |        ✓        |        —        |

✓ means supported; — means unsupported. `X` denotes the patch version. Use the
latest patch release in each minor release series. Backported support is marked
with the first supporting patch version.

| Release |             Minimum Slurm (Data Parser)             |
| :------ | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| `1.3.X` | [25.11][slurm-25.11] ([v0.0.44][slurm-data_parser]) |
| `1.2.X` | [25.11][slurm-25.11] ([v0.0.44][slurm-data_parser]) |
| `1.1.X` | [25.11][slurm-25.11] ([v0.0.44][slurm-data_parser]) |
| `1.0.X` | [25.11][slurm-25.11] ([v0.0.44][slurm-data_parser]) |

## Limitations

- Bridge jobs use exclusive, whole-node allocations by default. Workloads that
  request non-exclusive placement always use Slurm MCS workload isolation.
- Supports [DRA Driver CPU][dra-driver-cpu] for CPUs, plus indexed GPU and
  accelerator drivers mapped to Slurm GRES through configured device profiles.
  The chart includes profiles for [DRA Example Driver][dra-example-driver] and
  [NVIDIA DRA Driver][dra-driver-nvidia-gpu] GPUs plus RDMA-capable [DRANET]
  devices by default, and retains its specialized
  [NVIDIA k8s-dra-driver-gpu][nvidia-dra-driver] path.
- NVIDIA GPU backend selection is resource-name based:
  `deviceclass.resource.kubernetes.io/gpu.nvidia.com` selects the NVIDIA DRA
  DeviceClass, while `nvidia.com/gpu` selects the NVIDIA device plugin.
  `DeviceClass.spec.extendedResourceName` aliases are not resolved by
  `slurm-bridge`; use the implicit DeviceClass resource name for NVIDIA DRA.
- Native `cpu` requests do not activate CPU DRA. Pods must explicitly request
  `deviceclass.resource.kubernetes.io/dra.cpu` and cannot combine it with native
  `cpu` requests or limits.
- Native CPU requests reserve CPU capacity in Slurm, but do not constrain the
  container to Slurm's allocated CPU set. Native containers share CPUs not
  claimed through DRA, so native Slurm allocations may overlap their effective
  CPU sets; use CPU DRA for aligned CPU isolation.

## Installation

Create a secret for slurm-bridge to communicate with Slurm.

```sh
export $(scontrol token username=slurm lifespan=infinite)
kubectl create namespace slurm
kubectl create namespace slurm-bridge
kubectl create secret generic slurm-bridge-token --namespace=slurm --from-literal="SLURM_JWT=$SLURM_JWT" --type=Opaque
```

Install the slurm-bridge scheduler:

```sh
helm install slurm-bridge oci://ghcr.io/slinkyproject/charts/slurm-bridge \
  --namespace=slurm --create-namespace
```

For additional instructions, see the [quickstart] guide.
