| scheduler.featureGates | object | `{"DRAExtendedResource":true,"DynamicResourceAllocation":true,"SchedulerPopFromBackoffQ":false,"SlurmBridgeGenericWorkload":true}` | Scheduler feature gates. SlurmBridgeGenericWorkload requires a supported built-in Workload and PodGroup API at startup; disable it for clusters without those APIs. It is independent of Kubernetes' GenericWorkload feature gate. |
| scheduler.image | object | `{"pullPolicy":"IfNotPresent","repository":"ghcr.io/slinkyproject/slurm-bridge-scheduler","tag":""}` | The image to use, `${repository}:${tag}`. Ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#image-names |

| scheduler.verbosity | integer | `nil` | Set the verbosity level of the scheduler. |
| schedulerConfig.clientBurst | integer | `nil` | Set the scheduler plugin's own Kubernetes client Burst. Defaults to kube-scheduler's own client Burst (100) when unset. |
| schedulerConfig.clientQPS | float | `nil` | Set the scheduler plugin's own Kubernetes client QPS. Defaults to kube-scheduler's own client QPS (50) when unset. |
| schedulerConfig.mcsLabel | string | `"kubernetes"` | Set the Slurm MCS Label to use for external jobs. Ref: https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#OPT_mcs-label |
| schedulerConfig.nodeSharing | string | `""` | Set how bridge jobs share hybrid nodes with native Slurm jobs. Empty keeps time-only sharing. `coResident` lets pods and native jobs share a node core by core and requires `mcsLabel: ""`. `exclusive: "true"` still takes a whole node. |
| schedulerConfig.partition | string | `"slurm-bridge"` | Set the default Slurm partition to use for external jobs. Ref: https://slurm.schedmd.com/sbatch.html#OPT_partition |
| schedulerConfig.requireCPUDevice | bool | `false` | Require every co-resident pod container to request a core-bitmap CPU DeviceClass, such as `dra.cpu`, instead of setting a CPU limit. This pins pods to the cores Slurm allocated, keeping them off native jobs' cores. Requires `nodeSharing: coResident`. |
| schedulerConfig.schedulerName | string | `"slurm-bridge-scheduler"` | Set the name of the scheduler. |
| sharedConfig.deviceProfiles | string | `nil` | DRA DeviceProfiles recognized by Slurm Bridge. A DeviceClass resolves to a profile when its single CEL selector exactly matches `selector`. `name` becomes the Slurm GRES type and must remain stable while allocations using the profile exist. `driver` must be a Kubernetes DRA driver name and `backend.type` must be `core-bitmap` or `indexed-gres`; indexed GRES names must be DNS-1123 labels of at most 60 characters. Leave this `null` to use the built-in profiles shown below, or set it to `[]` to disable all DeviceProfiles explicitly. |
| sharedConfig.slurmJwtSecret | corev1.SecretKeySelector | `{"key":"SLURM_JWT","name":"slurm-bridge-token"}` | The Secret and key containing the Slurm JWT. The token is mounted and read before each Slurm REST API request to support rotation. |
| sharedConfig.slurmRestApi | string | `"http://slurm-restapi.slurm:6820"` | The Slurm REST API URL in the form of: `[protocol]://[host]:[port]` |
